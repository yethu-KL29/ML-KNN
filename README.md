# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification. KNN is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on the majority class of the K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. In this project, KNN is used for a classification task. It works by finding the K training examples that are closest to the new data point and predicting the most common class among them.

### Key Concepts:
- **Distance Metric**: KNN uses a distance metric (typically Euclidean distance) to find the nearest neighbors.
- **K Parameter**: The value of K determines how many neighbors are used for classification.
- **Voting**: The predicted class is determined by the majority class among the K nearest neighbors.
